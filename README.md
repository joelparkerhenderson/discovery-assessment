<h2>Purpose</h2>


<h3><a name="sbs">Strategic Balanced Scorecard (SBS)</a></h3>

Strategic Balanced Scorecard is a high level way to summarize an organization:

* Create a a destination statement.
* Cover four areas: financial, internal, external, learning.
* Define Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).
* Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and measure them.

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/strategic_balanced_scorecard


<h3><a name="okr">Objectives &amp; Key Results (OKRs)</a></h3>


OKR is a method of defining objectives and tracking their outcomes:

* Objective: what we want to achieve
* Key Results: how do we know we are getting there

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/objectives_and_key_results


<h3><a name="kpi">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</a></h3>

Key Performance Indicator (KPI) suggestions:

* Title: an exact name that avoids ambiguity
* Objective: the relation of the indicator with the organizational objectives must be clear
* Scope: state the areas of business and/or parts of the organization that are included and/or excluded.
* Target: benchmarks must be determined in order to monitor progress.
* Calculation: the exact formula, units, frequency, data soure, et al.
* Owner: the accountable person for the indicator.
* Comments: any outstanding issues regarding the indicator.

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/key_performance_indicator


<h3><a name="csf">Critical Success Factors (CSFs)</a></h3>

Critical Success Factor (CSF) suggestions:
