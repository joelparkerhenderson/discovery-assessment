## Purpose


### Strategic balanced scorecard (SBS)

Strategic balanced scorecards are a high-level way to summarize an organization:

* Create a a destination statement.

* Cover four areas: financial, internal, external, learning.

* Define objectives and key results (OKRs).

* Define key performance indicators (KPIss) and measure them.

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/strategic_balanced_scorecard


### Objectives &amp; key results (OKRs)


OKR is a method of defining objectives and tracking their outcomes:

* Objective: what we want to achieve

* Key Results: how do we know we are getting there

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/objectives_and_key_results


### Key performance indicator (KPI)

Key performance indicator (KPI) suggestions:

* Title: an exact name that avoids ambiguity

* Objective: the relation of the indicator with the organizational objectives must be clear

* Scope: state the areas of business and/or parts of the organization that areincluded and/or excluded.

* Target: benchmarks must be determined in order to monitor progress.

* Calculation: the exact formula, units, frequency, data soure, et al.

* Owner: the accountable person for the indicator.

* Comments: any outstanding issues regarding the indicator.

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/key_performance_indicator


### Critical success factor (CSF)

Critical success factor (CSF) suggestions:

* Title: an exact name that avoids ambiguity

* Objective: the relation of the indicator with the organizational objectives must be clear

* Criticality: why is this critical to the success of the objective?

* Plan: who is doing what, when, where, how?


### SMART criteria

SMART criteria for goals:

* Specific

* Measurable

* Actionable (a.k.a. Achievable, Attainable, Agreed)

* Relevant (a.k.a. Realistic, Responsible, Receivable)

* Timely (a.k.a. Time-scoped, Time-boxed, Time-bound)

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/smart_criteria


## People


### RACIO responsibility assigment matrix

RACIO responsibility assigment matrix:

* Responsible

* Accountable

* Consultable

* Informable

* Omittable

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/racio_matrix


### Stakeholder analysis

Stakeholder analysis starts by gathering this information:

* Name 

* Title

* Contact information

* Communication preferences

* Role in the organization

* Role on the project

* Key concerns (e.g. goals, needs, issues, interests, opinions)

* Key offerings (e.g. skills, resources, controls, connections)

* Relevant suggestions (e.g. for people, processes, tools, scopes)

* Relevant relationships (e.g. with stakeholders, projects, organizaitons)

* Relevant analysis (e.g. [SBS](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/strategic_business_scorecard), [OKR](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/objectives_and_key_results), [KPI](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/key_performance_indicator), [VSM](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/value_stream_mapping), [SMART](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/smart_criteria), SWOT, PEST, RAID)

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/stakeholder_analysis


### Stakeholder salience

Stakeholder salience means understanding the relative priorities of needs

To do this, one way is to estimate any of the concepts below, on a scale of low, medium, high:

* Power

* Interest

* Commitment

* Support

* Influence

* Need

* Urgency

* Understanding

* Legitimacy

* Willingness to engage

* Necessity of involvement

### TEAM interpersonal aims

TEAM interpersonal aims means:

* Talk

* Evaluate

* Assist

* Motivate

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/team_focus


### FOCUS analytical aims

FOCUS analytical aims means:

* Frame

* Organize

* Collect

* Understand

* Synthesize

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/team_focus

### DMADV Design For Six Sigma

DMADV project methodology is known as Design For Six Sigma (DFSS) and features 5 phases:

* Define design goals that are consistent with customer demands and the enterprise strategy.

* Measure CTQs (characteristics that are Critical To Quality), capabilities, prrisks etc.

* Analyze to develop and design alternatives

* Design an improved alternative, best suited per analysis in the previous step

* Verify the design, set up pilot runs, implement the production process and hand it over to the process owner(s).

## Performance


### Maturity models

Maturity models typically have these kinds of levels:

* 0 = None, Never, Negligible, Not Applicable

* 1 = Initial, Informal, Implicit, Irregular, Inconsistent, Individual-usage.

* 2 = Developing, Describing, Duplicating, Department-usage.

* 3 = Standardizing, Specifying, Scaling, Service-oriented, Segment-usage

* 4 = Managing, Measuring, Mainstreaming, Mission-oriented, Mass-usage

* 5 = Optimizing, Orchestrating, Ongoing, Opportunity-oriented, Organization-usage

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/maturity_models


### Value stream mapping (VSM)

Value Stream Mapping (VSM) starts with three major categories:

* Value Adding (VA): any activity that your external customers value and are willing to pay for.

* Necessary Non-Value Adding (N-NVA): any activity that is necessary but does not add value, for example any necessary support processes, legal regulatory requirements, etc.

* Unnecessary Non-Value Adding (U-NVA): any activity that is unnecessary, a.k.a. waste.

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/value_stream_mapping


### Software quality attributes

### Current state vs. future state

The exercise idea: assess the current state of the organizations/groups/individuals, and compare that to the desired future state.
