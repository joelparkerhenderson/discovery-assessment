## Purpose


### Strategic balanced scorecard (SBS)

Strategic balanced scorecards are a high-level way to summarize an organization:

* Create a a destination statement.

* Cover four areas: financial, internal, external, learning.

* Define objectives and key results (OKRs).

* Define key performance indicators (KPIss) and measure them.

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/strategic_balanced_scorecard


### Objectives &amp; key results (OKRs)


OKR is a method of defining objectives and tracking their outcomes:

* Objective: what we want to achieve

* Key Results: how do we know we are getting there

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/objectives_and_key_results


### Key performance indicator (KPI)

Key performance indicator (KPI) suggestions:

* Title: an exact name that avoids ambiguity

* Objective: the relation of the indicator with the organizational objectives must be clear

* Scope: state the areas of business and/or parts of the organization that areincluded and/or excluded.

* Target: benchmarks must be determined in order to monitor progress.

* Calculation: the exact formula, units, frequency, data soure, et al.

* Owner: the accountable person for the indicator.

* Comments: any outstanding issues regarding the indicator.

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/key_performance_indicator


### Critical success factor (CSF)

Critical success factor (CSF) suggestions:

* Title: an exact name that avoids ambiguity

* Objective: the relation of the indicator with the organizational objectives must be clear

* Criticality: why is this critical to the success of the objective?

* Plan: who is doing what, when, where, how?


### SMART criteria

SMART criteria for goals:

* Specific

* Measurable

* Actionable (a.k.a. Achievable, Attainable, Agreed)

* Relevant (a.k.a. Realistic, Responsible, Receivable)

* Timely (a.k.a. Time-scoped, Time-boxed, Time-bound)

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/smart_criteria


## People

### Stakeholder analysis

Stakeholder analysis starts by gathering this information:

* Name 

* Title

* Contact information

* Communication preferences

* Role in the organization

* Role on the project

* Key concerns (e.g. goals, needs, issues, interests, opinions)

* Key offerings (e.g. skills, resources, controls, connections)

* Relevant suggestions (e.g. for people, processes, tools, scopes)

* Relevant relationships (e.g. with stakeholders, projects, organizaitons)

* Relevant analysis (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/strategic_business_scorecard">SBS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/objectives_and_key_results">OKR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/key_performance_indicator">KPI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/value_stream_mapping">VSM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/smart_criteria">SMART</a>, SWOT, PEST, RAID)

* Talk

* Evaluate

* Assist

* Motivate

## Performance


### Maturity models</a>

Maturity models typically have these kinds of levels:

* 0 = None, Never, Negligible, Not Applicable

* 1 = Initial, Informal, Implicit, Irregular, Inconsistent, Individual-usage.

### Value stream mapping (VSM)</a>

Value Stream Mapping (VSM) starts with three major categories:

* Value Adding (VA): any activity that your external customers value and are willing to pay for.

* Necessary Non-Value Adding (N-NVA): any activity that is necessary but does not add value, for example any necessary support processes, legal regulatory requirements, etc.

* Unnecessary Non-Value Adding (U-NVA): any activity that is unnecessary, a.k.a. waste.

See https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/value_stream_mapping

### Current state vs. future state

The exercise idea: assess the current state of the organizations/groups/individuals, and compare that to the desired future state.
